This is a GNU Radio module to receive and reencode signals of (some) wireless car key fobs from Hella.


### Development

Like GNU Radio, this module uses *maint* branches for development.
These branches are supposed to be used with the corresponding GNU Radio
branches. This means: the *maint-3.7* branch is compatible with GNU Radio 3.7,
*maint-3.8* is compatible with GNU Radio 3.8, etc.


## Dependencies

GNU Radio


## Installation

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

## Usage

See the flow graphs in the apps folder.


## Frame Format and Crypto

I recommend checking out the paper *Lock It and Still Lose It &ndash; On the
(In)Security of Automotive Remote Keyless Entry Systems* by Flavio D. Garcia,
David Oswald, Timo Kasper and Pierre Pavlid√®s, presented at the 25th USENIX
Security Symposium.

The paper covers the frame format, crypto, and security issues of wireless key
systems. This transceiver supports what the authors call VW-3 and VW-4.
According to my understanding, the WAV files (i.e., signal samples) in this
repository and a firmware dump of the ECU should be a good starting point to
clone key fobs and to extract the master key.

There is also a [Wired
article](https://www.wired.com/2016/08/oh-good-new-hack-can-unlock-100-million-volkswagens/)
on it.


## Further Information

I [blogged](https://www.bastibl.net/gr-keyfob/) about the module and gave a talk
at [SDR Academy](http://www.sdra-2015.de/)
([slides](https://fleark.de/keyfob.pdf) and
